## LinkedList Accumulator Exercise

This exercise involves implementing a very basic version of a linked list. It includes a generic implementation of a
Node class, which is capable of holding any non-primitive data type and contains a link to its next Node. The LinkedListAccumulator
is a simple implementation of a LinkedList which can add Integer values to the end of the list and which can sum those
values and return them.

The objectives of this exercise are:
* To provide an opportunity to practice the use of generics in Java.
* To familiarize students with the concept of a LinkedList.
* To provide an opportunity to practice creating recursive methods.

### Exercise Tasks

There are three tasks involved in this exercise, all of which involve implementing some portion of the LinkedListAccumulator class.

* Implement the constructor
* Implement the add() method.
* Implement the sum() method.

### Getting started

1. Note the Main class, which contains the standard main() method. This class provides an example usage of the LinkedListAccumulator. You can run the main method to see it in action.
2. There are three TODO comments which indicate where the code should be implemented. There are also Javadoc comments on all of the relevant areas of the code describing what the behavior of the class is. 
3. There are several unit tests that have been provided, in the LinkedListAccumulatorTest class. These tests will all initially fail. Once you begin implementing the functionality of the class the tests will begin passing. When all tests are passing you have completed the exercise.
